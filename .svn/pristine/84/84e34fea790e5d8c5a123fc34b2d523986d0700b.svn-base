Important dependency information:

IGLU requires the following:
  * GLEW 1.7 or later, which includes OpenGL 4.2 API definitions.  On some
    nasty Linux systems (Xubuntu), the packaged libglew may not be new enough,
    so you will need to download and compile from source ("make;make install")
    However, beware that some of these systems *also* do not store libGLEW in
    standard locations, so "make install" may leave older versions around.
    This may cause link errors (on OGL 4.2 functions) when trying to use IGLU.
  * A graphics driver supporting OpenGL 4.2+ (if you just want to compile IGLU,
    having GLEW 1.7+ is sufficient)
  * FFmpeg for video functionality.  I used FFMpeg 0.9.1.  For Windows, the
    headers and lib files are available on my graphics NAS
    (Graphics_Group/Libraries/FFmpeg).  On Linux, FFmpeg 0.9.1 should be
    downloaded as source (the binary distributions don't seem to include the 
    headers and .a/.so files).  Compiling is out-of-the-box 
    ("./configure;make;make install") as long as your system has yasm 
    installed.  I've been able to use packaged yasm distributions (e.g.,
    "apt-get install yasm" worked for me).
  * For compiling the samples, you need GLUT or FreeGLUT.

As of now, in the Makefile/Visual Studio project you need to manually specify 
the location of your FFmpeg installation.  Ideally, this will go away once I/we
have more time.

LINUX USERS:  Please note, our development is mostly on Windows.  At this point
we are not using a fancy build management system, so when new classes and their
class files are added to the project, we may not add them into the Makefile.  
Frequently the library will still compile (via 'make') but will not contain all
the functionality of the Windows systems (e.g., some sample may fail to link
due to missing classes).  Usually this is slovable by simply adding the files
into the makefile's list of targets.
